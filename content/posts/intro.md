## Welcome

Welcome to my blog, and thanks for stopping by. This site will serve as my public notepad, where I'll be writing about topics that mostly got my attention while I was tinkering with topics like:

* Functional Programming in Clojure, Lisp, F#, OCaml and Haskell;
* Low-level programming (some ANSI C, m68k/x86 assembly etc.);
* Distributed systems, especially in the realm of filesystems and databases;
* Database internals and architecture;
* Concurrent programming (e.g. Go language).

Hopefully you'll find some of that stuff usefull and interesting.

Regards,
Chris
